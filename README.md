# Challenge

## Option 1: Portfolio Performance

Build a SPA application where portfolio managers can enter their client's assets portfolio distributions at some past date and see how much money would be worth today.

#### Example: 
- Client name: John Smith 
- Start Date: 2024-01-10
- Initial Balance: $500K
- Portfolio Allocation:
  - AAPL: 20%
  - GOOG: 80%

The app should show client's individual stock performance and overall portfolio return. Basic requirement is to show these data as a table. 
Optionally feel free to visualize the output as you see fit (Aggregate portfolio returns chart, Portfolio Allocation evolution over time, etc). 

Additionally the app should allow portfolio managers to view all previous request data, i.e. list of previous searchs PM initiated. 
You can display these past searches as a table where client name and time are shown, you can show the actual portfolio performance data upon click.

To obtain the historical returns you can use this free API https://www.worldtradingdata.com/

## Option 2: Financial assistant chatbot

Build a web-based chat application powered by LLM and agent. 

Requirements:
 - Your chatbot should utilize agent and general knowledge/reasoning of LLM to answer basic financial related questions
 - All chat messages need to be persisted in database
 - The chatbot should have basic memory capability in order to carry coherent conversation

You can choose any Open AI models as the LLM of your choice. We will provide a test Open AI key for you to use in your development.
Feel free to directly use Open AI API calls or use any existing LLM frameworks like Langchain or Llamaindex.

For simplicity, you can use this free search API provided by https://tavily.com/ to power your agent.
